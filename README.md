# Picofthedaybynasa-chrome-extension-
So I created an extension that loads "image of the day" from nasa.gov. It is a simple project but fun to do.
Steps to use:

1) Download every single file 
    Background.gif
    b.jpg
    logo.png
    manifest.json
    new.html
    popupp.html
    script.js
    style.css
    style2.css
    
2) You can add different gifs and logos, also you can change the background image.
    Background.gif - it's the bg, which is shown on the first page itself.
    b.jpg - it's a blurred image that shows up before loading the actual image of the day.
    logo.png - its the logo (should be 128 X 128 transparent image)
    
3) once downloaded, go to chrome://extensions
4) click on the load unpack option from the top left corner
5) upload the downloaded files.
6) boooom! you are good to go!
